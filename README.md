# botSorceryQuest

# This is a series os bots created long time ago when I didn't knew the existence of github. 

# At the time I was trying to learn python by myself, doing it as a hobby.

# The objective of the bots was to log in and do activities inside a game called "Sorcery Quest". 
# Like logging, checking the health and mana of the party, healing if necessary, and go farm items and experience for the characters.
# The bots were very crude, but did the job at the time.

# Today the servers of the game were discontinued.
